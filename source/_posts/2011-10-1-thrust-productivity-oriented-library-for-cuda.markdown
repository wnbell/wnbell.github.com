title: "Thrust: A Productivity-Oriented Library for CUDA"
categories: publications
abstract: "This chapter demonstrates how to leverage the Thrust parallel template library to implement high-performance applications with minimal programming effort. Based on the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), Thrust brings a familiar high-level interface to the realm of GPU Computing while remaining fully interoperable with the rest of the CUDA software ecosystem. Applications written with Thrust are concise, readable, and efficient."
